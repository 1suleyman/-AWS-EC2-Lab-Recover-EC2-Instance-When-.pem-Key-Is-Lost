# -AWS-EC2-Lab-Recover-EC2-Instance-When-.pem-Key-Is-Lost
In this lab, I learned how to regain access to an EC2 instance after losing the original SSH private key (.pem) by injecting a new public key through User Data and IAM instance profile permissions. I also verified that the instance was running an application on port 80 using Docker and confirmed recovery via the new key.
